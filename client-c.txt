PRODUCT PACKAGE COUNTER PROGRAM

Step 1. START program 

	NOTE: Package scanning begins

Step 2. ASSIGN starting number value of 2 once first package scanned

	NOTE: 2 is used as starting number value because each package scanned = 2 products

Step 3. ASSIGN maximum number value to 50

	NOTE: 50 is used for maximum number value because each case holds 50 products 

Step 4. DISPLAY Current Number Value

	NOTE: Current Number Value will be the current number of packages scanned

Step 5. ADD 2 to Current Number Value after next package is scanned

Step 6. REPEAT Step 4 and Step 5 until Current Number Value = 50 (maximum number value)

Step 7. END program once Current Number Value = 50
